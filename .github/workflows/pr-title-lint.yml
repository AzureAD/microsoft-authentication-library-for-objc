# IMPORTANT: This workflow is using a centralized PR Title validation as a reusable workflow from the AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-tokenbroker-for-objc repository. This helps ensure there is only a single source of truth for PR title linting across repos.
#
# The PR title lint workflow lives in the 'dev' branch of 'azure-activedirectory-tokenbroker-for-objc'.
#
# To update or modify PR title requirements, ONLY edit the file:
#   https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-tokenbroker-for-objc/blob/dev/.github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml
#
# For more information on reusable workflows, see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows
