name: PR Title Lint

# This workflow uses a centralized, reusable workflow from the tokenbroker repository.
# 
# Why use 'uses:' with a centralized workflow?
# - Single source of truth: All PR title validation logic is maintained in one place
# - Consistency: Ensures uniform PR title standards across related repositories
# - Easier maintenance: Updates to validation rules only need to be made once
#
# Why '@dev'?
# - '@dev' references the default branch of the tokenbroker repository
# - This ensures we always use the latest approved version of the validation logic
# - Provides stability while allowing centralized updates without changing this file
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not modify PR title validation logic here!
# All modifications to PR title validation rules should be made in:
# AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-tokenbroker-for-objc/.github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml
# on the default branch (dev).
