    The completion block which returns the scanned QR Code value or an error in case of failure.
 
 @abstract
    Async request for scanning a QR Code. After caling this method YubiKit will prompt the user to scan
    the QR Code using a built-in UI presented modally on top of the specified presenter. YubiKit allows to
    customize the default messages shown in the library UI. This can be done by setting localized values
    in YubiKitExternalLocalization.
 
 NOTE:
    Before using this method make sure the project is properly configured to allow the usage of camera. YubiKit provides
    the ability to check if the device supports QR Code scanning by using the shared instance deviceCapabilities
    from YubiKitManager.
