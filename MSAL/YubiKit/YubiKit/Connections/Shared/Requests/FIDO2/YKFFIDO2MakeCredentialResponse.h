/*!
 @abstract
    The response to a FIDO2 Make Credential request. The result contains the data structures defined in
    the CTAP2 authenticatorMakeCredential command response.
 
 @discussion
    For convenience, there are some derived properties which can be used on the client to check some parsed
    parameters of the response, but they should not be necessary in the client-server communication.

 @discussion
    Currently this property provides the same CBOR map as the rawResponse. In this map the attestation
    object is using numeric keys for fmt, authData and attStmt, as defined by the CTAP2 specification:
    https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.html#responses

    Returns the CTAP2 attestation object in WebAuthN format.
 
 @discussion
    This property returns a CBOR map with the content identical to the ctapAttestationObject, except
    for the keys, which are text, as defined by the WebAuthN specifications:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/attestationObject
 */
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSData *webauthnAttestationObject;

/*!
 @abstract
    The authenticatorData is a derived property which will be lazy created by parsing the authData property value.
 
 @discussion
    The information provided by this property should not be required by the server. The client should treat the
    Make Credential result as an opaque object and send it to the authentication server to be processed. However,
    the information provided by this object can be used by the client to inspect some authenticator and response
    properties.
