 @class YubiKitExternalLocalization
 
 @abstract
    YubiKitExternalLocalization allows the host application to provide localized strings for messages
    shown to the user when YubiKit shows system UIs or build-in UI elements.
 
 NOTE:
    YubiKit already provides some generic non-localized values for the elements shown in the UI. While these are good
    for a prototype phase, for production builds, it is recommended for the host application to provide localized
    values specific for the type of application using the library.
